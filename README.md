## Developer

I'm a self-taught PHP dev with genuine distrust for all things frontend. There is no real beauty in software development rather than clean and organized backend.

## Teacher 

More than five years of having a job in education taught me that knowledge must be shared and shared with passion. Any article of mine aims to be as useful as possible for people who want to learn.


## Technical Lead

My guilty pleasure is organizing processes. Guides, policies, developing and implementing strategies within a team, creating metrics - that's at least half of my job.
